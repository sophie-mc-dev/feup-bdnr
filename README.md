## Project setup
Here are the full steps to get the project up and running:
1. Navigate to the **src/** folder.
2. Run the **server.sh** script. **NOTE:** if you're running the project in Windows, run ```bash server.sh``` and, in case you're in a UNIX based OS, simply run ```./server.sh```. If the script fails to run on Linux, try adding the execution permission by running ```chmod +x server.sh```. If it still doesn't execute correctly, try running it with Admin permissions.
3. Open your browser and go to **localhost:8091** and login with the default credentials.

**Note:** you can also already generate some data by going to the **data/** directory and running the **generate.py** Python script. However, keep in mind that, for the moment, you can neither pass the data into the server, nor this is the final version of the used data.
